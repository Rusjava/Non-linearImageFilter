            <h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>The nonLinearImageFilter application allows one to apply either linear Gaussian filter or non-linear Gaussian filter to grayscale
                    images. The images can loaded from TIFF, PNG, GIF and JPEG grayscale files. The program also supports generation of test images. The filtered images can be 
                    saved as grayscale TIFF, PNG and GIF files or as uncompessed AVI or QuickTime videos.</p>

            <h1>Description</h1>
		<h2>Mathematical model</h2>
                <p>The linear Gaussian filtering is performed by solving the linear diffusion equation for image brightness <i>b</i> with a constant diffusion 
                    coefficient &eta;:</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">&part;b/&part;n=&nabla;(&eta;&nabla;b),</p>
                <p>where <i>n</i> is the filtering step number and the gradient is in the image coordinates.</p>
                <p>In non-linear Gaussian filter the diffusion coefficient is Gaussian function of the gradient of image brightness <i>b</i>:</p>
                <p style="text-align:center">&eta;=&eta;<sub>0</sub>&times;<i>exp(&minus;(&nabla;b<b>&sigma;</b><sup>&minus;1</sup>)<sup>2</sup>)</i>,</p>
                <p>where <b>&sigma;</b><sup>&minus;1</sup> is the inverse of the 2D matrix of non-linear coefficients.</p>
		
		<h2>Filtering procedure</h2>
		<p>Use <b>Initialize</b> button to either generate a new test image (with a square) or load a new image from file. Then choose filter parameters: diffusion coefficient, non-linear 
                    coefficient and number of filtering steps. Tick <em>Non-linear filtering</em> box if non-linear filtering is required. Press <em>Filter</em> button to begin 
                    filtering. Observe as the filtering is going by looking at the <em>Progress bar</em>. The process can be stopped by pressing <em>Stop</em> button. The 
                    filtering can be continued after adjusting parameters. The sequence of filtered images can be viewed by moving the slider in <em>Controls</em> panel. 
                    The currently visible image can be saved by using <em>File->Save current image...</em> menu item. The full image sequence can be save as AVI or QuickTime 
                    uncompressed video by using <em>File->Save as video...</em> menu option.</p>
		
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<p><em>Options->Test image options..</em> allows one to specify: the test image width and height, the signal level outside the square, the noise level and 
                    the relative scale of the square. <em>Options->Filter options...</em> allows one to enter the relative numerical precision of non-linear filtering,
                    filtering anisotropy (ratio of the main axes of the matrix <b>&sigma;<sup>&minus;1</sup></b>) as well
                    as the number of threads used to filter the image. The default number of threads equals the number of available processors.</p>
                
                <h2>Measuring performance</h2>
                <p>
                    After the filtering the time spent (in nanoseconds) is displayed in the right part of the <em>status bar</em>, which also shows the number of available
                    processors as well as the number of threads employed in calculations.
                </p>
                <h2>Internationalization</h2>
                <p>
                    To launch the program with the Russian interface, start it with 'ru' key like: 'NonLinearImageFilter.jar ru'.
