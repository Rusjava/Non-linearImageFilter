            <h2 class="header">Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Shadow file converter transforms binary <code>SHADOW</code> files such as <code>BEGIN.DAT</code> to text files 
                preserving their structure. The converter can also convert these text files back into the 
                binary Shadow format.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="header">How to perform conversion</h2>
            <p>From the drop down menu choose the direction of conversion: from a binary <code>SHADOW</code> file to 
                a text file or from a text file to a binary <code>SHADOW</code> file. Press <em>START</em> button and choose a source and 
                destination files. The conversion process begins and its progress can be observed looking at
                the progress bar. The process can be interrupted by pressing the <em>STOP</em> button.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">Changing conversion parameters</h2>
            <p>Select <i>Options -> Parameter...</i> and enter the maximum number of rays to process and the first 
                and last columns to write into the text file. The last option is only available if conversion from
                binary files to text files is selected.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">Changing skin</h2>
            <p>Select <i>Options -> Look&mp;Feel...</i> and choose a new Look &amp; Feel.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">Running scripts</h2>
            <p>Select <i>Options -> Scripts...</i> and in the window that appears type a new script in <code>Tcl</code> language
                to manipulate data in <code>SHADOW</code> files.
